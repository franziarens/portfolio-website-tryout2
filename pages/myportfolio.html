                            <p>In the context of a university project, together with a team of six people,
                                we created the concept and produced a show called "Soundhunters" conisting
                                of 6 episodes. Every episode was organized, filmed and edited in one week. 
                                My role in this production was the main camera operator and DOP, as well as
                                script writer together with the Director. The episodes can be found on Matters, 
                                a student streaming platform made by students from NHL Stenden via this link. </p>

                            <p>I concepted and designed a magazine about Ocean conservation in
                                South Africa via InDesign. My motivation was the volunteer work in marine
                                conservation in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa, that I pursued after my graduation.
                                This topic is a passion of mine: I enjoyed interviewing my coordinator and ocean 
                                conservationist Melissa Nel for this and learning more from her. </p>

                            <p>I absolved two online courses in the year of 2022: Fundamentals of Digital Marketing (Google) & The Manager's Toolkit: A Practical Guide to
                                Managing People at Work (Coursera).
                                This enriched me in my theoretical knowlegde on leading and organizing, as well as practicial information 
                                in digital marketing.<br><br>
                                I also absolved a course in photography and videography, organized by students experienced in the field.
                                This helped me develop a basic understanding in camera work, sparked my interest in visual storytelling and
                                enriched my creative thinking skills. <br><br>
                                Next to this, I also absolved a Dutch course, A1 level, to be able to adapt more to my environment
                                in the Netherlands and be able to communicate or understand clients of university projects and
                                restaurant work.
